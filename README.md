# Description:
From the heart of the land of olives and resilience, our ambition and passion as Palestinian students have flourished. We aspire to represent our country in the best light possible. This is our compass, this was our goal, and this is what aided us in achieving it at the purpose academy, specializing in robotics and artificial intelligence, located in the economic capital of Palestine, Ramallah.
Welcome to our journal. Here, you will journey with us as we construct our robot from scratch. We are three Palestinian students (Tala, Sarah, Amro), brought together by our shared passion for technology. Our aim is singular: to integrate artificial intelligence, 3D design, programming, and more into a single robot. Under the guidance and training of Engineer Mohammed Ma'mar, Palestinian efforts over three months came together to build this robot.
## Parts list
## *Raspberry Pi 4:
https://www.raspberrypi.com/products/raspberry-pi-4-model-b/
The Raspberry Pi 4 is a versatile single-board computer equipped with a quad-core Cortex-A72 processor, up to 8GB of RAM, dual HDMI ports, USB 3.0 and USB 2.0 ports, and Gigabit Ethernet. It includes a 40-pin GPIO header for connecting various peripherals and built-in Wi-Fi and Bluetooth for wireless communication, making it ideal for numerous applications in education, robotics, and DIY projects.
## *Arduino Uno:
https://store.arduino.cc/products/arduino-uno-rev3
The Arduino Uno is a popular microcontroller board based on the ATmega328P. It features 14 digital input/output pins, 6 analog inputs, a USB connection, a power jack, and a reset button. Ideal for beginners and experienced developers, it's widely used for creating interactive projects and prototypes.
## *The L298N Motor Driver:

The L298N Motor Driver module facilitates bidirectional control of DC motors or stepper motors with four input pins for direction and two enable pins for speed regulation via PWM. It's popular in robotics and DIY projects for its built-in protection diodes and wide motor voltage compatibility (7V to 35V), ensuring robust and flexible motor control solutions.
## *Servo motor MG995:

The MG995 Servo Motor is renowned for its precise angular position control using PWM signals. Operating between 4.8V to 7.2V, it delivers significant torque, making it ideal for robotics and mechanical applications requiring accurate and controlled movements.
## *pixy2 camera:
https://pixycam.com/pixy2/
Pixy2 is smaller, faster and more capable than the original Pixy.  Like its predecessor, Pixy2 can learn to detect objects that you teach it, just by pressing a button.  Additionally, Pixy2 has new algorithms that detect and track lines for use with line-following robots.  The new algorithms can detect intersections and “road signs” as well. The road signs can tell your robot what to do, such as turn left, turn right, slow down, etc.  And Pixy2 does all of this at 60 frames-per-second, so your robot can be fast, too.
## *MPU-9250:
https://learn.sparkfun.com/tutorials/mpu-9250-hookup-guide/all
The MPU-9250 is an integrated motion-tracking sensor module that combines a gyroscope, accelerometer, and magnetometer. It is widely used for precise measurement of orientation, acceleration, and magnetic fields in applications ranging from drones and robotics to wearable devices.
## *HC-SR04 Ultrasonic Sensor:
https://www.sparkfun.com/products/15569
The HC-SR04 Ultrasonic Sensor uses ultrasonic waves to determine distances by measuring the time taken for the waves to reflect back from an object. It's widely employed in robotics for precise obstacle detection and distance measurement tasks due to its reliability and straightforward interfacing capabilities with microcontrollers, we used 5 ultrasonic sensors , 3 in the front , one on the right side of the robot and one on the left side of the robot.




## Behind the Scenes: Tackling Technical Hurdles in Our Robot Project:
Despite being an unforgettable experience, like any other journey, it was filled with obstacles. We cannot deny that the resilience ingrained in us by our Palestinian heritage helped us overcome these challenges. This competition was our first experience in building and programming a robot. None of the team members had ever participated in such an event before. This was our first hurdle: three of us venturing into the unknown. Many questions plagued us and we faced a lot of hardship during our quest for answers. How do we build and design a robot from scratch? What do we need? How do we make this robot overcome obstacles? What is the best way to make this robot recognize colors? Many questions needed answers, and the journey to find them was arduous. But as Palestinians, we do not know the meaning of surrender.
## The First Hurdle:
While trying to find a solution for the obstacle challenge round, we needed to program the robot to recognize red and green traffic signs. What should we do? We researched and read a lot about the OpenCV library and decided to use it to enable the robot to perform color detection. This was our first experience with image processing. However, we faced many difficulties when using OpenCV; the detection was not accurate. We tried multiple times to fix the issue but eventually decided to abandon OpenCV and use the Pixy2 camera, which is specifically designed for color recognition.
## From Concept to Creation: Innovating Our Robot with Artistry
The WRO rules allowed us to use a ready-made robot structure, but Team Kufiyatech refused the easy route. As we are Equipped with specialized training from the Purpose Academy in FreeCAD design platform, we decided to take the challenging path. We embarked on designing our robot from scratch and 3D-printing it. This journey required meticulous attention and focus; we had to redesign several times until we found the perfect design. This step consumed considerable time and effort from our team, with special thanks to Sara Jawaada, our team member responsible for the design.
